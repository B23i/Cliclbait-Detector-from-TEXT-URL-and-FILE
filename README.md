# Cliclbait-Detector-from-TEXT-URL-and-FILE
This program was developed by Ali M. Kandemir and Bilal Ä°zzettin for the Data Mining course. It uses BERT and TF-IDF models to detect clickbait in text, with extra URL and file options for input. Accuracy is limited due to the unreliable dataset used in training.
